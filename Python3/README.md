# Python Programming Language

- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language 
- Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
- Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.
- python2 is deprecated. we will use python3

---

## Run a simple Python Program

1. First ww will install python3.
    ```bash 
    $ sudo apt install python3
    ```

1. Create .py extension file and write python program. Refer code- [simple_program.py](./simple_program.py)

1. As python is interpreted language, we can direct run the program without compiling it first.
    ```bash
    $ python3 simple_program.py
    ```

## Python Language Features

1. __Easy To Code and Code Readability__
1. __Object Oriented__
1. __Dynamic-Typed language__
1. __Platform Independent__
1. __Large Standard Library__


## Application and Real-World Example
- __Machine Learning__ -> best ML library (sklearn, numpy, TensorFlow)
- __Server-side Programming__ -> (Frame-work: django, Flask)
- __Automation__
- __Graphic User Interface(GUI) Application__ -> (PyQt5 is the most popular )

## Advantage
- Great open source library.

## Disadvantage

- Performance slow than cpp.
