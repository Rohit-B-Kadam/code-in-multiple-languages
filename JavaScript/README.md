## I] Run Javascript on Browser

1. Required any browser.

1. Create two file

    ```

1. Install required packages

    $ npm install prompt-sync
    ```

1. Write a simple JavaScript code [simple-program.js](./run-on-node/simple-program.js)

1. Run simple-program.js on nodeJs
    ```bash
    $ node simple-program.js
    ```
## JavaScript Language Features

1. __Object Oriented__
1. __Dynamic-Typed language__


## Application and Real-World Example

- __Server-side Framework__ -> (Express ,Nest.js, sail.js, ..etc)
- __Desktop Application__ -> (Electron)
- __Mobile Application__ -> (React native, Ionic )

## Advantage
- Can create all type of application

## Disadvantage
